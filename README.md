# PMMA Polymerization Mathematical Model

MAster's Degree in Chemical Engineering Final Project.  Jun 2017
This is the work I develop on my visit to the [Technical University of Buenos Aires][itba].  
**Note**: The entire project was develop in Spanish.

For this project I built a mathematical model for a novel technique for the polymerization of the Poly-Methil-Metacrilate.

**Tech**: Matlab

## Initiator
The contribution in our work is the use of a novel technicque for the polymerization consisting on the use of symetric cyclic multifunctional initiators:
  - DEKTP: Diethyl ketone triperoxide
  - PDP: Pinacolone diperoxide

The decompositions of both initiators are shown below:
